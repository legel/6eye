How do I use BRTP Free?

First, drag the "RetroPrinterScriptBasic.cs" script on top of an object in your scene. Then, in the script's inspector panel you have to select the "Object To Update" property and point it to the 3D Text object that will print your text. Then all you need to do is to enter the lines you wish to print into the Full Text property and you're all set. You might want to tweak the remaining script properties to achieve the desired effect.
